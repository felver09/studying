energy stored in an inductor | W = ½ LI 2
inductors in series | add the inductances
inductors in parallel | same as resistors in parallel
When an inductor with no current flowing through it is first switched into a circuit, it behaves like | an open circuit.
When a constant, unchanging current is flowing through an ideal inductor, the inductor behaves like | a short circuit.
steady state current | VS÷R
calculating i | i = (VS÷R) (1 - e ^ -t÷ (L÷R))
equation for time constant | t = L/R
